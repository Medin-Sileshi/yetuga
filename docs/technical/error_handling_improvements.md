# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

The Yetu'ga application has been enhanced with robust error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes and provide a better user experience, especially during the initial loading of events and when processing event data. These improvements focus on gracefully handling null values, providing appropriate fallbacks, and ensuring the UI remains responsive even when errors occur.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Robust Event Deduplication

The event deduplication process has been improved to handle edge cases and prevent null reference errors:

- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks in the `_removeDuplicateEvents` method
- Added validation for empty content keys
- Ensured the method always returns a valid list even when errors occur

### 2. Enhanced Event Cache Initialization

The event cache initialization process has been improved to prevent crashes during app startup:

- Enhanced the `_cleanupDuplicateEvents` method to properly initialize caches for all filters
- Added error handling to prevent crashes during cache initialization
- Ensured empty caches are created when errors occur to prevent null references

### 3. Filter Validation and Error Recovery

Added validation and error recovery for filter-related operations:

- Added validation in `_buildFilteredContent` to ensure filters are valid
- Added a fallback to the 'NEW' filter when an invalid filter is detected
- Improved error handling throughout the filter-related methods

### 4. Stream Error Handling

Enhanced stream error handling to prevent crashes when streams encounter errors:

- Added error handling to the `_getFilteredEventsStream` method
- Used `.handleError()` on streams to gracefully handle errors without crashing
- Ensured empty lists are returned instead of null when errors occur

## Implementation Details

### Event Deduplication Error Handling

```dart
List<EventModel> _removeDuplicateEvents(List<EventModel> events) {
  try {
    // Validate input list - return empty list if null
    if (events.isEmpty) {
      return [];
    }

    // Use a map to track unique events by content key
    final uniqueEvents = <String, EventModel>{};

    // Add each event to the map, using the content key to identify duplicates
    for (final event in events) {
      try {
        final contentKey = event.contentKey;
        
        // Skip events with empty content keys
        if (contentKey.isEmpty) {
          Logger.e('HomeScreen', 'Skipping event with empty content key: ${event.id}');
          continue;
        }

        // Process event...
      } catch (e) {
        // If there's an error processing this event, log it and skip
        Logger.e('HomeScreen', 'Error processing event during deduplication: ${event.id}', e);
        continue;
      }
    }

    // Return the values from the map as a list
    return uniqueEvents.values.toList();
  } catch (e) {
    // If anything goes wrong, log the error and return an empty list
    Logger.e('HomeScreen', 'Error in _removeDuplicateEvents', e);
    return [];
  }
}
```

### Stream Error Handling

```dart
Stream<List<EventModel>> _getFilteredEventsStream(String filter, EventService eventService, {DocumentSnapshot? startAfter}) {
  try {
    // Ensure filter is valid
    if (filter.isEmpty || !_filters.contains(filter)) {
      filter = 'NEW';
    }

    // Get the appropriate stream based on the filter
    switch (filter) {
      case 'JOINED':
        return eventService.getJoinedEvents(limit: _eventsPerPage, startAfter: startAfter)
          .handleError((error) {
            Logger.e('HomeScreen', 'Error getting JOINED events', error);
            return <EventModel>[];
          });
      // Other cases...
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // If anything goes wrong, log the error and return an empty stream
    Logger.e('HomeScreen', 'Error in _getFilteredEventsStream', e);
    return Stream.value(<EventModel>[]);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When implementing error handling in the application, follow these best practices:

1. **Always use try-catch blocks** for operations that might fail, especially during initialization
2. **Provide meaningful fallbacks** when errors occur (empty lists, default values, etc.)
3. **Log errors with context** to help with debugging
4. **Check for null or empty values** before using them
5. **Handle stream errors** using `.handleError()` to prevent stream termination
6. **Validate input parameters** to ensure they meet expected criteria
7. **Use the mounted check** when updating the UI after async operations

## Testing

To test the error handling improvements:

1. **Fresh Install Test**: Install the app on a new device and verify it loads without errors
2. **Network Interruption Test**: Toggle airplane mode during app usage to test offline handling
3. **Invalid Data Test**: Introduce invalid data in the database and verify the app handles it gracefully
4. **Memory Pressure Test**: Test the app under low memory conditions
5. **Rapid Action Test**: Perform rapid UI actions to test debounce mechanisms

These improvements ensure that the app can gracefully handle errors during the initial load and throughout its lifecycle, providing a better user experience even when issues occur.
